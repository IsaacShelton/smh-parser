# SMH SPEC v1.0

Simple Markup language for Humans and isaac



### Introduction

smh is a markup language that's designed to have the readability of yaml with the simplicity of json.



*"So simple, you can write your own parser"*



There are three types:

- String

  *The only escapes that are guaranteed to be recognized by the parser are `\"`,  `\\`, and `\n`* 

  *Literal newline characters are only included in strings when using double quotes*

  ```
  this is a string
  "this is a string"
  1.0.0
  3.14159
  123456789
  ```

- Array

  ```
  [this, is, an, array]
  
  - this
  - is
  - an
  - array
  ```

- Object

### Conventions

There are no `true`, `false`, or `null`, but your code may use strings to represent them.

When this is the case, it's convention to use:

- `true`/`"true"` for true
- `false`/`"false"` for false
- `null`/`"null"` for null



### Why not use X instead?

Why not just use YAML?

- YAML has a ton of unnecessary "features"
- Way more convoluted than it should be
- Virtually none of the parsers implement the entire spec
- Behaves in suprising, inconsistent, and unexpected ways

Why not just JSON?

- Not as human readable
- Lots of extra characters which make it harder to manipulate quickly

Why not just use TOML?

- It's not as flexible
- It's not as human readable

Why not just use XML?

- It's incredibly verbose and repeats itself
- Ugly and not very human readable

**Why SMH?**

- So simple, you can even write your own parser
- Human readable
- No ambiguity
